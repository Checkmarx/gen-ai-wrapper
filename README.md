# Introduction

The GPT-Wrapper repository, maintained by the Checkmarx AI squad, offers a Golang abstraction layer designed specifically for interacting with generative AI models, primarily focusing on OpenAI's GPT models. This SDK simplifies the processes of making API calls with or without conversation history and augments robust error handling. Tailored features have been incorporated to suit Checkmarx's specific requirements and use cases.

### Customized Solutions for Checkmarx Special improvements and optimizations for Checkmarx use cases, improving reliability and performance in internal products.

## Features
** Abstraction over GPT API: Facilitates communication with OpenAI's language models using Golang, abstracting the complexities of direct API interactions.
** History Tracking: Allows API calls to retain the state of the conversation, thereby enabling context-aware dialogues with the models.
** Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling mechanisms to deal with common and uncommon issues gracefully during API interactions.

## Support
For any issues or support needs, please contact the Checkmarx AI squad through our internal communication channels or open an issue on this repositoryâ€™s issue tracker network.

Thank you for using Checkmarx for robust and effective AI solutions. Happy building with the enhanced GPT-Wrapper SDK!
