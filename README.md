# gpt-wrapper

# Introduction

The GPT-Wrapper repository, maintained by the Checkmarx AI squad, offers a Golang abstraction layer designed specifically for interacting with generative AI models, primarily focusing on OpenAI's GPT models. This SDK simplifies the processes of making API calls with or without conversation history and augments robust error handling. Tailored features have been incorporated to suit Checkmarx's specific requirements and use cases.

### Customized Solutions for Checkmarx Special improvements and optimizations for Checkmarx use cases, improving reliability and performance in internal products.

## Features
** Abstraction over GPT API: Facilitates communication with OpenAI's language models using Golang, abstracting the complexities of direct API interactions.
** History Tracking: Allows API calls to retain the state of the conversation, thereby enabling context-aware dialogues with the models.
** Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling mechanisms to deal with common and uncommon issues gracefully during API interactions.

## Support
For any issues or support needs, please contact the Checkmarx AI squad through our internal communication channels or open an issue on this repository’s issue tracker network.

Thank you for using Checkmarx for robust and effective AI solutions. Happy building with the enhanced GPT-Wrapper SDK!

# GPT-Wrapper - GoLang Abstraction for OpenAI LLM
Customized Solutions for Checkmarx Special improvements and optimizations for Checkmarx use cases, improving reliability and performance in internal products.

## Overview
GPT-Wrapper is a robust GoLang repository designed as an abstraction layer for easy communication with OpenAI's language models (LLM). It is principally aimed at providing a simplified SDK to facilitate direct interactions with OpenAI LLM models, supporting calls with or without history tracking. Enhanced error handling mechanisms are integrated to improve reliability and user experience.

This repository has been developed and is maintained by the Checkmarx AI Squad, incorporating custom features aligned with Checkmarx's requirements and standards.

## Features
- **Simplified SDK**: Easy-to-use functions to manage interactions with OpenAI's LLMs.
- **History Management**: Optional tracking of interaction history for detailed logs and audits.
- **Customized Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling specifically tailored for more resilient and fault-tolerant system operations.
